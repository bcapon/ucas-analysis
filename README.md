Student satisfaction is a significant metric in higher education, influencing institutional rankings, funding, and policy decisions. This R project analyses data from 116 British universities, sourced from The Guardian University Guide Ranking 2025 and the 2022 UCAS Equality Report, to examine how institutional and demographic factors influence student satisfaction with feedback. To this end, a Bayesian Generalised Linear Model (GLM) is employed using rstan to identify key drivers of feedback satisfaction.
